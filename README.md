Simple Note Taking App
======================

Uses:
 - Angular JS (+ ngRoute)
 - jQuery (for now)
 - Twitter Bootstrap (for now)
 - JSON2 (Need to support IE8)
 - Underscore (For filtering data)
 - Chosen (for tagging notes)
 - Summernote (for simple/elegant/repsonsive WYSIWYG)


 This is really me just playing around with Angular and building something...pretty simple app, just needed to get my fingertips dirty.
